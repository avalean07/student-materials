-- Exercises:
-- 1. Implement the functions we left as `sorry` in the lecture.
-- 2. In the last lecture, we defined an InsertionPoint type and implemented
--    a find_insertion_point function.  Do this for RBTrees as well.
-- 3. Write a BST predicate for RBTrees and ancestries.
-- 4. Prove that your find_insertion_point function finds the right
--    location (i.e. that the value to be falls within the interval
--    permitted by the hole).
