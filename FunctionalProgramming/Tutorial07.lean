-- Exercises:
-- 1. Prove the size lower bound theorem stated in the lecture.
theorem size_lower_bound {t : RBTree α c k} : 2^k ≤ t.size + 1 := by sorry

-- 2. State and prove a similar size upper bound theorem.

-- I've incorporated many simple questions into the homework, so I think more exercises here are unnecessary.
