# Functional Programming, Constructor University Bremen, 2025-2026

In this course, we will learn how to work with the Lean 4 language.
Please note that Lean 3 is very different.

Learning goals:
1. Learn to read and write code in a functional style.
2. Learn to work with Lean as a programming language.
3. Learn to reason about your code in Lean.

Materials:
- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/)
- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)

They are usually online, but exceptions will be announced
occasionally.

The tutorial sessions are at 11:15 on Friday, and are on
campus.

Homework assignments are available through GitHub Classrooms and must be handed
in by 9:30 on Fridays (15 minutes before the lecture starts).

## Grading

Your homework and exam contribute 50% of your grade each.
You need at least 45% on both to pass.

There is one homework assignment per lecture.
The homework submission is organised via GitHub Classroom,
see below.

There are no individual extensions, replacement exercises,
or anything else of the sort possible for the homework.

The exam will be on paper.  The date will be announced later.

There are some practice problems that you can do during the
tutorial session.  These do not need to be handed in and do
not contribute to your grade.
